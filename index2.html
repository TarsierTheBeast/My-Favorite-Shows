<h1>What are the Best Episodes?</h1>
<h2> The Pitch </h2>
  <p>
    The Pitch is an episode in which George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld attempt to pitch a "show about nothing".  While doing this, George gets into a relationship with Susan Ross, an executive at NBC. George later brings her to Jerry's apartment, where Kramer proceeds to accidentally drink spoiled milk and vomit on Susan.  Before this, George ruins his and Jerry's chances at NBC taking their show by going on a rant when they express displeasure at the show's idea about nothing.

<h3> The Handicap Spot </h3>
  <p>
    In The Handicap Spot, George parks in a handicap spot with his dad's treasured car.  He comes out of the store much later than he thought he would, and finds his dad's car completely destroyed.  It turns out he parked in a handicap spot and a handicapped woman had to park far away.  Later in the episode, Kramer falls in love with the same woman and buys her a used wheelchair.  She uses it for the first time while going down a very steep hill, but the wheelchair's breaks were broken.  The episode ends with her trying to stop while screaming.
