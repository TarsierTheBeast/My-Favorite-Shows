<h2> The Pros of Spongebob: </h2>
  <p>
Spongebob, like Seinfeld, has a usually limited amount of characters in a single episode.  This helps watchers to recognize main or vital characters in an episode.  However, in Spongebob, the locations of episodes may vary a lot.  One episode may take place in two different places at the same time.  This allows for a viewer to not be too focused on a certain location.

<h3> My Favorite Episode of Spongebob </h3>
  <p>
  My favorite episode of Spongebob is episode 52a from season 3.  This episode is known as the 'Choclate Episode'.  It involves Spongebob and Patrick's adventures as they go around town trying to sell chocolate to people.  They meet a man that screams choclate until Spongebob and Patrick leave, a man that breaks every bone in his body when he wakes up, and an old lady that remembers when choclate was invented.
