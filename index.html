<h1>Who are the characters?</h1>
<h2> The Main Characters: </h2>
  <p> The main chracter is Jerry Seinfeld, played by Jerry Seinfeld.  In the show he plays as a comedian that lives in Manhattan.  Jerry's friend, George Costanza, is featured in every episode in the 9 seasons the show had, except for one episode in season 3.  George is a short, stocky, slow-witted bald man.  Throughout the series, he is constantly unemployed and in and out of jobs.  Elaine Benes, friend of George and Jerry, is the main female character in the series.  She is Jerry's ex girlfriend and they remained friends afterwards.  The final main character, and my favorite, is Cosmo Kramer.  He is called Kramer for almost the entire series as his first name was revealed late in the 6th season.  He is notable for his wild personality and exagerated entrances.  He has many memorable episodes, such as when he sliced ham to slide under a door, to feed a cat.  In that same episode, he says that he, "cuts slices so thin you can't even see them.".

<h3> Notable side characters: </h3>
  <p> One of the most notable and memorable side characters is the Soup Nazi.  He is featured in the 116th episode of the Seinfeld series.  He is known for owning a soup stand and being very strict about the actions of people in line.  If someone is being too loud, he will refuse to serve them.  Another character is Poppie.  He is seen in a few episodes, but Poppie is a very well known side character for the episode called 'The Pie.'  The Pie is the 79th episode in the Seinfeld series.  Poppie is known from this episode as Jerry walks into the restroom to find Poppie in there as well.  However, before Jerry leaves, Poppie leaves without washing his hands.  Jerry expresses his disgust at this by refusing a slice of pizza.  Later in the episode, a health inspector comes to Poppie's restaurant and shuts it down.
