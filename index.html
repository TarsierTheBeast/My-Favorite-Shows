<h1>Why is Seinfeld the best show ever made?</h1>
<h2> The Pros of Seinfeld: </h2>
  <p> There are many positive things in Seinfeld that easily outweigh the negatives of the show.  One example of this is that the same characters, excluding side characters or episode specific characters, are found throughout the season in nearly every episode. Having the same episodes throughout the season allows newer watchers to easily remember the names of the main characters.  Another example of things staying same is the settings that characters will find themselves in during most episodes.  Knowing where someone else is can help you predict what might happen, or what character you might see in the current or next scene.  Another very good thing about Seinfeld is that the shows are only thirty minuntes, and can be stopped and picked up later, especially if you would not want to invest too much time into an episode.

<h3> The Cons of Seinfeld: </h3>
  <p> I personally cannot think of very many bad things about Seinfeld.  One perhaps could be that you might waste a whole day watching it.  You also might get sad once some of the minor characters or episode specific characters are not featured in any other episodes.  The only other bad thing I can think about in Seinfeld would be the end, as it signified the end of one of the best, if not the best, television shows ever made.  One final negative thing is that if there is a minor character, you will usually not find them in any on any other episodes.  This is sad for characters like the Soup Nazi, who many wished was in more episodes.
